title:  "The Two Most Important Questions"

##### How & Why

When trying to understand your customers there are only two questions you should worry about -- "how?" & "why?"
For example, understanding **how** your customers checkout on your e-commerce web site is important because you want to see where people are abandoning their carts before they finish.
"How" is about the steps customers take to complete a task.

Understanding **why** customers cancel their account with your company is important because it lets you make changes to help retain future customers.
"Why" is about the steps customers take that lead up to an action.


##### The Disconnect

Unfortunately the analytic tools available to us don't answer these questions.
Instead, these tools tell us things like where in the country our users come from, how many times our web page was view or how many times our app was downloaded.
Knowing that a high percentage of females from Kansas went to your sign up page doesn't help you understand why they got there.
These are [bullshit metrics](http://allthingsd.com/20121217/andreessen-and-mixpanel-call-for-an-end-to-bullshit-metrics/).

What we need are analytic tools for understanding customer behavior.


##### What's Next

This has been a frustration for me for years.
[I've spoken on it several times](https://speakerdeck.com/benbjohnson/behavioral-analytics-understanding-the-why-and-how-of-your-users) and I even went so far as to [write an open source database](http://skydb.io/) to solve the problem.

Today I'm happy to announce that I'm releasing a hosted behavioral analytics platform called [Landmark](http://landmark.io) into beta.
If you are interested to know more about how and why your customers behave the way they do, [please e-mail me](mailto:ben@skylandlabs.com) or [sign up for the beta](http://landmark.io/users/sign_up).
